# Craft Cloud Code & NextJS Boilerplate

> This Cloud Code supports Node.js LTS version, nodemon, Jasmine, ESLint & ES6 modules.

Please read our blog about writing better Cloud Code - https://docs.thebrewery.app/blog/2021/05/20/better-cloud-code 

## The Basics

 - **What is Craft** - A fully-managed serverless API development platform with scalable NodeJS Rest & GraphQL API, easy to use CMS, CRUD, Object and File storage, built-in Hosting, User Management, Push Notifications, System Emails, Cloud functions & Jobs, Real-time messages, and more out of the box.
 
 - **What is Next.js** - A great JavaScript framework that lets you easily build a complete web application with React and server-side rendering. 
 
 - **What is Cloud Code?** - For complex apps, sometimes you just need a bit of logic that isnâ€™t running on web browser or mobile device. Cloud Code makes this possible. Cloud Code is easy to use because itâ€™s built on the same Parse JavaScript SDK that powers thousands of apps. The only difference is that this code runs in your Parse Server rather than running on the userâ€™s mobile device or web browser. When you update your Cloud Code, it becomes available to all web and mobile environments instantly. You donâ€™t have to wait for a new release of your application. This lets you change app behavior on the fly and add new features faster.


## How does this work?

The project is developed as a Next.js boilerplate for Craft applications. The platform allows implementation of server-side logic and has a built-in Express, which is directly mounted to the server. We use Express for handling the Next.js and you may find the respective logic at `cloud/app.js`

## Installation

**1. Clone the repo**

Go to <code>```Craft > My Apps > Your App Settings > Cloud Code Repo```</code> and clone your repo

```
git clone https://gitlab.stratpoint.dev/your-project-name
cd your-project-name
```

**2. Install Dependencies**

```
npm install 

-or-

yarn install
```

**3. ENV Variables**

Make a copy of `.env.example` and name it `.env`

it should be something like this:
```
DATABASE_URI=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/test
IS_DEVELOPMENT=1
```

**4. Development**

```
npm run dev

-or-

yarn run dev
```

If everything is okay you should see an output similar to this one:
```
Running on http://localhost:1337
info: Parse LiveQuery Server starts running
Defining routes from exportPathMap
[ ready ] compiled successfully

```
**5. Go wild and unleash your Next.js creativity into the `./src` folder.** 

**6. Open http://localhost:1337 in your browser and see the changes ðŸ˜‰**
